        <Paragraph>
          Key Crusher is a web app designed to calculate a user&apos;s typing
          statistics such as words-per-minute (wpm or WPM), accuracy, and
          read-to-type/text time (RTT).

            <Paragraph>
              The daily challenge is a new and random challenge generated
              everyday at 12:00am PST. The same set of words are given to
              everyone.

            <Paragraph>the rate at which a user can type</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              This is calculated by dividing the total number of correct keys
              typed by 5 and then dividing by the challenge duration.

              the measurement from when you begin processing the next character
              to type and when you actually press the key
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              For example, if you were typing the word &quot;crusher&quot; and
              have already typed &quot;cr&quot;, the RTT for key &quot;u&quot;
              would be the time between pressing &quot;r&quot; and pressing
              &quot;u&quot;.

              a measurement of how correct your input was relative to the
              challenge text
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              This is calculated by dividing the total number of correct keys by
              the total number of keys typed.
